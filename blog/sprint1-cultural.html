    <p>
      Countless times in my personal training career I would have potential
      clients come in for a consultation. After chatting to them about how it
      works, assessing their movement, and generally getting to know them a bit
      to see if we’d be a good fit, it would then be time to build their plan.
      Sometimes that plan included me training them, and other times I would
      have to refer out. On one such occasion early on in my career while I was
      still building a client base, I had a potential client who was looking to
      train for 5 times a week. They had some fairly advanced athletic goals
      that required periodised programming, nutritional support and frequent
      check-ins to ensure they would get where they needed to go. They were also
      willing to pay in advance for an entire month, which at the time was a
      heck of a lot of money. At this time, I was fresh out of study and hadn’t
      dived into enough detail to fully support their needs. The dilemma was; to
      take their money, scrape together a facade of professionalism while I
      desperately attempted to learn everything I needed to know and taking time
      away from looking after my other clients, but alleviating a lot of
      financial stress, OR, let them know I’m probably not a good fit and refer
      them on to someone who is. The plan going into business was to always
      remain transparent and act with integrity, so I ended up referring the
      potential client onto one of my colleagues who was better suited for this
      individual. In the end they signed up with them and my colleague passed
      some clients my way slightly down the line who he thought were a good fit
      for me. The clients got what they were after and I built some
      relationships that resulted in me still filling my roster.

    <h3>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h3>
    <p>
      A lot of my values around keeping an open mind and, ’to live and let
      live’, I would say come from growing up in a culture that stresses
      individualism. From kindergarten through to the work space there have been
      countless examples of how others have chosen to live their lives that have
      differed from how I go about it. All of this has influenced my open minded
      outlook on life, and built up my respect and understanding for how others
      go about making their decisions in life. That same culture has also
      sparked my curiosity in trying new things. Seeing how other people go
      about tackling situations and what values they hold dear has taught me to
      always try out new things and spend time in uncomfortable situations, so
      that they may be less uncomfortable in the future, and so I can see things
      from another perspective.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey
      and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.
    </h3>
    <p>
      My strengths are; rational and decisive decision making, confidence in my
      own ability, focused and hard working attitude, highly organised, ability
      to set priorities, analytical mindset. These are going to benefit me
      during my ongoing learning and career development as they all work to help
      me mange my own time and set expectations of what I can achieve given the
      effort I put in. It’s useful in helping to set clear goals and in building
      a roadmap to my ideal scenario with clear steps along the way, and
      milestones to reach as I go.
    </p>
    <p>
      My analytical mindset can also be a limitation at times. If I don’t fully
      understand why something is how it is, sometimes I can find it difficult
      to move on, and it can end up consuming too much of my attention. But over
      time I’ve generally been able to recognise when this is happening and peel
      to the next task.

      Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work
      productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the
      strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your
      reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.

    <p>
      In my 2nd year of university, and my 1st year flatting. Myself and my
      other two flatmates had a taxation group project we were doing together.
      We split up the work to do so that we each had about a 1/3 of the project.
      The plan from the outset was to do our segments, and then go over each
      others work to make sure everyone had done their part and that it was all
      ready to be presented. We would set times where we new we would all be at
      the flat so that we could help each other out if need be. The problem was
      we all had different abilities, and priorities. Two of us were often at
      the flat together when we had decided we should work on the project, the
      third however would turn down planned study time for usual uni
      shenanigans; partying, catching up with friends. When asked how he was
      getting on with his portion of the project the answer was always along the
      lines of ‘good’, ‘easy’, ‘nearly done’. Then it came to the night before
      presentation was due and the two of us who’d been working together at the
      planned times were quite stressed as we hadn’t actually seen any evidence
      of how the third flatmate was getting on with it. We stayed up until they
      got back from the end of a late work shift to make sure they were ready
      for the presentation, as it was marked as a group. 11:00pm the night
      before it was due, he hadn’t even started. So we had a bit of an argument
      about it, and then reluctantly caffeinated up and began helping him with
      his work. Finishing up the project by 2:00am. As I write about this I can
      see a lot of flaws with how the situation was handled. The strategies used
      to try and resolve the issue were no more than a quick message and then
      taking his word for it while we brewed over how annoying that was. I would
      definitely change it up if I could go back as they were not effective at
      all and only lead to excessive stress and lack of sleep. Now days I would
      have given him a call rather than a message, made sure I understood his
      situation and not just the fact that he hadn’t done it. I would ask if
      there was anything I could do to help rather than pushing him to just ‘get
      it done’, and just generally be a lot more accepting that his standard of
      work wasn’t necessarily the same as mine. I think this would lead to less
      overall stress (both in the flat and in tutorials) as I would have
      communicated with him that I was on his team rather than against him, and
      that I could help out if needed. I’ve communicated this way with group
      projects since and it’s always been very effective. Generally if everyone
      understands where each other is at and why, and problem can be worked
      around together, everyones happy.
