    <h3>What is your long term goal and or career pathway?</h3>
    <p>
      Over the next 3 to 5 years I’d like have completed my studies as a
      developer (here at dev academy) and secured a job as a developer either
      here or preferably in Melbourne. The plan has been to live in Melbourne
      for a while now as I prefer the bustling city life and have a lot of good
      friends over there. Currently I’m in stage one - Study how to be a
      developer.
    </p>
    <h3>
      What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed
      in yourself while at EDA?
    </h3>
    <p>
      I’d like to learn more about how to work within an office space. My work
      history has never included a corporate environment and I’m aware that it’s
      a different ball park to a gym floor or large kitchen. I’m interested to
      find out how the social norms differ. I think EDA will be able to expose
      me to that environment somewhat, and help build my ability to work in that
      sphere.
    </p>
    <h3>A description of your own strengths and limitations</h3>
    <p>
      I like to think I can work pretty well with others, and have a strong work
      ethic. I am very good at managing my own time and setting my priorities..
      for the most part. I’m also very driven towards my goal whenever I have a
      clear reason in mind for pursuing it. This is the focus I use to achieve
      just about everything I do. Flip side to that, sometimes I can be a bit of
      a perfectionist. This is a trait I’ve noticed in myself over the last few
      years and I’m continually trying to recognise when I’m getting that way
      and coming back to my priorities. I’ve never tried to navigate around a
      computer before this course as I didn’t think I would need it. So I feel I
      may be disadvantaged there and consider myself a bit of a noob. But so far
      it’s been fun to learn about.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your
      workload in this programme. This should include - an explanation of how
      you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other
      learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.
    </h3>
    <p>
      I’m going to make the most of my strengths and what we learned in week
      one, around the pomodoro technique and taking regular breaks, to guide my
      study and workload during my time at EDA. I’ve got my offical study time
      booked in my calendar between 8:30am-5:00pm every weekday, and then on the
      weekends the plan is just to get in at least 2 hours per day. I’ve burnt
      out in the past from not setting boundaries on when to work and when to
      relax so I know how important it is to me to have enforced ‘down time’.
      I’m also adopting the mindset that although offical study time finishes at
      5:00pm, if I wish to work on my own projects after this time then I can.
      I’m fairly in tuned with when I’ve had enough screen time so I feel
      confident I’ll be able to manage this well. As for working with everyone
      else. The plan is to stick to the usual of communicating myself and
      feelings/abilities to anyone I may be working with, and ensuring
      communication is kept up over the course of any projects. This way anyone
      I’m working with will know where I’m at and won’t get any nasty surprises
      if they expect something I’m not yet able to deliver. Facilitators will
      also be able to tailor my learning experience with this level of open
      comms so I can get the most out of my study. Of course I plan to always
      conduct myself with professionalism and respect others at all times, both
      during study and beyond in the industry.
    </p>
    <h3>
      A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Similar to above, If I find myself in a rut with work or for whatever
      reason in my ability to work alongside someone on a project I will
      communicate this to my facilitators and work colleagues as early as
      possible so plans can be changed and nobody loses out on any learning
      opportunities.
    </p>
    <h3>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h3>
    <p>
      I just expect that they’ll be there to assess my progress and make
      recommendations as to where I should be spending my time to maximise my
      time at EDA. And to listen to any concerns or compliments I have to give
      about any systems or processes.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed
      to other things. For example, you might have whanau commitments such as
      school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these in.
    </h3>
    <p>
      I have made allowances within my planned week to spend time with the
      friends and family and go for activities like running several times a week
      to keep up good mental health. I have cleared the schedule otherwise over
      my time at EDA so I can focus on my studies.
