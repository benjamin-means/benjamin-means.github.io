    <h3>HTML and CSS.</h3>

    <p>
      When thinking about the differences between HTML and CSS I find it most
      useful to think about them in terms of what their roles would be if
      building a house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first person you’re going to get to help build your house is HTML.
      Their job is to come along and lay-down the foundations of the house. They
      put up the wooden framing, section out different rooms, attach doors,
      insulate the place, add a roof, and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now you could save a lot on your house budget and leave it as is, but then
      it wouldn’t be such a nice place to live.So you decide to get another
      person to help design the house and give it more of that homely feel. You
      hire CSS.
    </p>
    <p>
      In they come with their designers eye and start adding wallpaper that
      match the rugs they’ve put down. They give the house a paint job, maybe
      kit out your bedroom with your favourite paintings that have been in
      storage for years. It’s their job to make sure that your house looks and
      feels homely, and so that visitors talk about their experience for years
      to come.
    </p>

    <h3>Control flow and loops.</h3>

    <p>
      Control flow in computer science is the order in which code is run. It can
      be changed with conditionals which interrupt the normal order of execution
      when certain conditions are met, such as a loop.
    </p>
    <p>
      A loop is a sequence of instructions that is continually repeated until a
      certain condition is met in computer programming.
    </p>
    <p>
      An example would be driving your car. The loop would first need to check
      that there is petrol in the car. It would stop running when the petrol
      became empty. With each iteration through the loop, as it checked there
      was still petrol in the car then it would burn some more petrol.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first statement (checking petrol is in the car), is only checked once
      right at the start.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second statement (petrol is still above 0), defines the condition
      needed to execute the third statement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third statement (burning some petrol), is run every time when the
      condition of statement two is met.
    </p>
    <p>
      This process is looped through continually until the car runs out of
      petrol.
    </p>
    <p>
      You could also nest an if…else statement within your loop if you chose
      too. That would check if you petrol light was on and then decide what to
      do.
    </p>
    <p>
      So for each iteration through the loop it could check; if the petrol light
      was off, keep burning fuel and loop again. If the petrol light is on, time
      to get more petrol.
    </p>

    <h3>The DOM and how you might interact with it.</h3>

    <p>
      The DOM is a browser provided JavaScript object that allows us to view and
      manipulate HTML and CSS elements. It is an object that has a plethora of
      properties and methods built in to help us do this.
    </p>
    <p>Just like a family tree only with one parent, and LOTS of children.</p>
    <p>
      Let’s say you wanted to select a bunch of elements on a page (lets go with
      all paragraphs) and apply all the same style to them. You could do this by
      creating a function through the DOM.
    </p>
    <p>
      First you would select the elements on the page with
      ‘document.getElementsByTagName(‘p’);’ and save that as a variable.
    </p>
    <p>
      You could then loop through all the paragraph elements and apply the
      colour green to them with a for loop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then you could call your function and BOOM, now all the paragraphs on the
      page have a green style applied to them.
    </p>
    <p>It could look like this;</p>
    <p>
      function makeGreen() { 
         <p> var element = document.getElementsByTagName('p');</p>
      <p> for (var i = 0; i < element.length; i++) {</p>
      <p> element[i].style.backgroundColor = 'green'; }</p> 
    <p> } ; </p>
    <p> makeGreen();</p>
    </p>
    <p>
      Just for fun, say you wanted to add some nifty function to your webpage.
      For example, you wanted to make an image spin faster as the mouse got
      closer to it, and slower as it got further away. The best place to do this
      would be through the DOM.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the DOM you could select the elements you wanted to target, in
      this example the img element and the mouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the DOM you could also say when you wanted to kick off the spinning
      by setting the event. In this case the event would be as the mouse moves.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the event kicks off, you want the img and the mouse to know how far
      apart they are, and then depending on that result, set the spin speed of
      the img.
    </p>
    <p>
      (if anyone know how to make this happen and have it not look like a DJ
      turntable please hit me up!).
    </p>

    <h3>Accessing data from arrays and objects.</h3>

    <p>
      The main difference between arrays and objects is that objects don’t track
      order, whereas arrays do.
    </p>
    <p>
      What this means is that when it comes to accessing data from an array it’s
      generally a bit easier if you happen to know the index of the element
      you’re looking for. You would use bracket notation to help you find the
      element.
    </p>
    <p>
      Otherwise you would have to iterate over the array to search for the
      element.
    </p>
    <p>Example</p>
    <p>Const names = [‘Ben’, ‘Michael’, ‘Lucy’, ‘Dries’];</p>
    <p>
      To access Michael, if you knew the index you would use bracket notation.
    </p>
    <p>Const secondName = names[1];</p>
    <p>
      If you didn’t know you would have to iterate through and search for
      Michael.
    </p>
    <p>Const Michael = names.find( names => name === ‘Michael’);</p>
    <p>
      With objects accessing data can be easier, as there is no concept of
      order.
    </p>
    <p>Const thing = {height: ‘large’, human:’false’, scary:’true’};</p>
    <p>To know if thing is scary you would use dot notation.</p>
    <p>Const thingScary = thing.scary</p>
    <p>
      Quite often you may find arrays within objects or, an array of objects. In
      which case you may have to use a combination iterating through the array,
      as well as dot and bracket notation to access the element you’re looking
      for.
    </p>

    <h3>Functions; what they are and why they are useful.</h3>

    <p>A function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.</p>
    <p>
      Functions are useful as they save us from having to continually re-type
      out the same code whenever we want to perform that task. Instead we can
      save the code as a function and call it whenever we want to perform that
      task.
    </p>
    <p>By calling a function we are invoking all of the code within it.</p>
