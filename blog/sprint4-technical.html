    <h1>Problem Solving</h1>

    <h3>The simple problem</h3>

    <p>Here is a story of when I got stuck by something rather simple.</p>
    <p>
      During week two of DevAcademy foundations I was tasked with creating a
      basic homepage for a website that would later host my blogs.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had already been in isolation for several weeks prior to this doing an
      online web development course. In that course I learned about bootstrap, a
      CSS framework. The framework is nice because it does a lot of the heavy
      lifting.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had the idea to create my homepage using the bootstrap framework as it
      was still (mostly) fresh in the think tank. One of the features I was
      really looking forward to adding to the homepage was the carousel, so my
      blogs could slide along the screen.
    </p>
    <p>
      I knew what I wanted and that was to have the buttons you click on to go
      to the next blog, and previous blog, stretch all the way to the corners of
      the window.
    </p>
    <p>This is where I got blocked.</p>
    <p>
      I couldn’t figure it out immediately, so I played around in DevTools for
      far too long, thinking that I could just trial and error my way through
      it. After much frustration at not being able to solve the issue I tried to
      re-watch old tutorials about the carousel. But I sped through them, angry
      at myself for not remembering, which only made it worse as I didn’t get
      anything out of that.
    </p>
    <p>
      After too much frustration I asked for help. Within literally 60 seconds
      my flatmate had come over to my laptop and analysed what I was trying to
      achieve. He goes:
    </p>
    <p>“Have you tried increasing the padding?”</p>
    <p>Problem solved. In less than 60 seconds. The Relief.</p>
    <p>
      What did I learn from this? Don’t be afraid to ask for help. Which brings
      me to my since acquired favourite proverb:
    </p>
    <p>
      "The person who asks is a fool for five minutes, but the person who does
      not ask remains a fool forever.” - Source unknown.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was a comical start to problem solving as a developer. Since then
      I’ve learned that there’s this thing called google, and we now get along
      very well.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this next story, my problem solving skills were considerably more
      thought out.
    </p>

    <h3>The elegant way</h3>

    <p>
      During week four of DevAcademy foundations I was practicing unit testing.
      In this particular test I had to write code that would:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Accept a string</li>
      <li>Filter out "buzz" (regardless of upper or lower case)</li>
      <li>Return the new buzzLess string</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I had a fairly good idea of what I thought the solution would be, and I
      was pretty amped. But this time before I got stuck into typing out the
      solution I thought I had best validate my assumptions with a quick google.
    </p>
    <p>
      I opened a new tab for each array and string method I though I would need,
      to make sure I understood what they did.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I quickly jotted down what I thought the solution would be as
      pseudocode on some paper, paused, had one last look over it to make sure
      it made sense, AND then I wrote it into the code editor.
    </p>
    <p>
      A spectacular failure, it returned a string with only ‘buzz’ words. So I
      immediately went to the tab that had the ‘.filter()’ open to have another
      read. I quickly realised my mistake, changed one symbol around in my code
      and BOOM, it worked.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time around the problem solving process was much less stressful. I
      actually rather enjoyed it.
    </p>
    <p>I learned a few things from this experience.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Google has the answers if you know what you’re searching for. If in
        doubt, google it. A quick google search is much better than smashing
        your head against the desk.
      </li>
      <li>I should read slower.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Those were just a few stories I wanted to share of my own experience with
      problem solving. The takeaway being, if one method isn’t work then try
      another!
    </p>
    <p>Here are a bunch more problem solving methods you could adopt.</p>

    <h3>Pseudocode:</h3>
    <p>
      This is essentially where you write out the code in plain English prior to
      translating it into actual code.
    </p>
    <p>
      I really like using this to get my ideas onto paper first so that I can
      make sense of them, rather than trying to go straight to the solution.
    </p>

    <h3>Trying something:</h3>
    <p>The method speaks for itself, give something a go.</p>
    <p>
      Hands down my favourite method. I feel I learn best when I just give
      things a go and see what happens. But it comes with a caveat, you have to
      reflect on what your input was and how that relates to the output.
      Otherwise you don’t get nearly as much out of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      So if you give something a go, I recommend taking a little time to
      understand what you did and how it gave you that result.
    </p>

    <h3>Rubber ducky method:</h3>
    <p>
      This is pretty nifty. The idea is simple, get a rubber ducky and explain
      things to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      There’s another level of learning that takes place when you’re forced to
      explain your understanding to another being (even if it is a squishy
      yellow bath toy).
    </p>
    <p>
      Honestly I’ve never tried doing this with an actual rubber ducky but I can
      see the benefit. I’ve played around substituting a rubber ducky with my
      flatmates and find it useful in exposing gaps in my understanding.
    </p>

    <h3>Reading error messages:</h3>
    <p>
      Pretty straight forward. Have a look at the error message and see what
      it’s trying to tell you.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m a big fan of this. More often than not it’s telling me my syntax is
      wrong and will even go so far as to point out what line I’ve made a
      mistake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other times it’s a little more difficult, but can at least point me in the
      direction of a more accurate google.
    </p>

    <h3>Console.logging:</h3>
    <p>
      As you go through your code, console.log small bits of code, functions,
      variables, and so on. I pretty much do this out of habit now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Console.logging helps you see what the the code is doing behind the
      scenes. I find it very useful in finding where things have gone wrong.
    </p>

    <h3>Googling:</h3>
    <p>The internet has all the answers if you know what the question is.</p>
    <p>
      I find the game with Google is to maximise the keywords you use. So say
      for example you wanted to find out how to filter a certain word out of a
      string, you could try; “filter string javascript”.
    </p>
    <p>
      This may not get you to the answer off the bat but you’ll learn a little
      more that’ll help you get there in the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      I like how googling things often has the side effect of providing you with
      information that you will find useful down the line, with other problems.
    </p>

    <h3>Asking your peers for help:</h3>
    <p>
      I find this approach useful for when you run into a problem that you can’t
      find the solution to on google.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the past I likely wouldn't have asked for help, but now I see the
      benefit in it. Chances are someone else has been or will be stuck there
      too and then you both get to learn from helping one another. It’s a WIN
      WIN.
    </p>

    <h3>Asking coaches for help:</h3>
    <p>
      I’ve absolutely no problem with this one. This is what coaches are for, to
      facilitate development.
    </p>
    <p>If all else fails, ask those who are the most experienced.</p>

    <h3>Improving your process with reflection:</h3>
    <p>
      As I said in my ‘Trying something’ rant, I think this technique is
      fundamental in any area of development.
    </p>
    <p>
      It can be done in a broad sense, where you reflect at the end of each day
      and ask yourself what you’ve learned, and what you could change next time.
      Or it could be done for individual tasks, with the same questions asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      I liken it to journaling/ use journaling as a way to continuously reflect
      on what has been done. I’m fairly biased but If you haven’t tried
      journalling before I highly recommend it.
