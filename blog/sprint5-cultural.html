    <h1>Reflection</h1>
    <h3>
      Three new things I have learned about myself and my ego as a result of the
      core learning.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Getting into the core exercises I thought that as I had: meditated in the
      past, learned about neurplasticity and growth mindset, worked one on one
      with other people for two years, and read a few books on the mind and the
      brain, that I wouldn’t get too much out of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the course of a few short weeks I was quickly met with the reality
      that this was not the case. I got, admittedly, quite a bit more out of
      core than I thought I would.
    </p>

    <p>
      I discovered that my ability to focus with intent was more limited that I
      would like. I was jumping ahead to possible solutions/scenarios before I
      had even finished processing the last thought. This left me with the
      feeling of starting each thought a thousand times before finally
      completing it.
    </p>

    <p>
      I also became very aware of how self-critical I was when my output didn’t
      meet my own expectations. Which in turn highlighted how much my ego was
      getting in the way of my ability to learn.
    </p>

    <p>
      All this lead to limited intake over the first few weeks. However I have
      been actively working to slow myself down, complete each task before
      moving onto the next, and giving myself credit where it’s due.
    </p>

    <p>
      Consequently I’ve been feeling more confident in my abilities, and notably
      more engaged in any scenario, coding or otherwise.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming.
    </h3>

    <p>
      I’d say my values play an important role in programming in that they help
      to keep good humour when things are becoming frustrating, and largely help
      to structure my approach to each problem.
    </p>

    <p>
      My values coupled with an ever increasing understanding of my own
      feelings, and ability to communicate them, has led to me staying more calm
      and less scattered whenever I feel myself becoming stuck.
    </p>

    <h3>What has surprised me the most about the core learning?</h3>

    <p>
      What has surprised me most about the core learning is definitely that by
      having a better understanding of myself, and how I process thoughts and
      emotions, I can tailor how I learn to better understand information as
      well as apply it.
    </p>

    <p>
      It seems silly to write that out, of course knowing yourself will lead to
      learning better. But it wasn’t until I actually took what I got out of
      core and applied it to how I approach problems that I really got to see
      notable improvements.
    </p>

    <h3>The most challenging aspects of the core learning.</h3>

    <p>
      I found the most challenge aspect of the core learning was how it
      confronted me with my own thoughts, and how I respond to them.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have done quite a significant amount of mediation in the past. But that
      was several years ago and I’ve clearly changed a lot since then. The core
      learning brought to light thought patterns that I didn’t think would be
      there, thought patterns that were getting int the way of learning. The
      silver lining however is that as uncomfortable as it was, now I know where
      to spend my ‘self-improvement’ energy.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Why do I feel EDA, a programming school, are spending so much time
      focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?
    </h3>

    <p>
      I suspect EDA spends such a significant amount of time on developing these
      core skills as they are both useful in developing us as human beings, and
      they play a vital role in securing employment.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every resource you read about employment in the tech industry (and most
      other industries) will tell you that your technical skills are important,
      but to really excel and get hired you have to also have to be a genuinely
      pleasant human to be around. You have to be able to work with others, and
      you have to be a good fit for the culture of the organisation.
    </p>

    <p>
      In developing these skills at EDA, they are putting all they can into
      turning us into employable junior developers within 12 weeks.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Does the time I spent studying core learning feel like a waste of time?
    </h3>

    <p>
      Although I could’ve used the time I spent on studying the core material to
      instead dive deeper into the technical side of things, I don’t think that
      would’ve been beneficial.
    </p>

    <p>
      The benefits I gained from working through the core material have allowed
      me to understand myself better, and to improve my learning process. As a
      result I’ve been able understand more of what I’ve learned and been able
      apply what I’ve learned more effectively to problems.
    </p>

    <p>
      Outside of programming it has undoubtedly made more a more attentive
      listener. A trait I’m sure those I’ve been engaging with have appreciated.
    </p>

    <p>Overall I think the core material has been hugely beneficial.</p>

    <h1>Preparing for Bootcamp</h1>

    <h3>Long term goal</h3>
    <p>
      Over the next 3 to 5 years I’d like have completed my studies as a
      developer (here at dev academy) and secured a job as a developer either
      here or preferably in Melbourne. The plan has been to live in Melbourne
      for a while now as I prefer the bustling city life and have a lot of good
      friends over there. Currently I’m in stage one - Study how to be a
      developer.
    </p>
    <h3>Biggest strengths and limitations at Bootcamp.</h3>
    <p>
      Going into bootcamp I think my biggest strengths are still going to be my
      ability to work with others and my ability to manage my time. My reason
      why I’m studying at EDA and where I want these skills to take me means a
      lot to me, and I’ll use that to stay focused.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the course of foundations I have discovered some areas for
      development within myself. I don’t think it will limit me too much during
      bootcamp, but It will be interesting to see how I can improve my ability
      to focus and what sort of results doing so will yield.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally I’ve also had the ego kicked down a few notches which I think
      will only benefit me when working with others. Sometimes having the ego
      take a few hits is exactly what’s needed.
    </p>
    <h3>Biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp.</h3>
    <p>
      I’m fairly certain that my biggest challenge will be communication.
      Speaking in front of groups whilst maintaining my usual thought process is
      definitely something I struggle with. As much as it will be uncomfortable,
      at least I’ll be better by the end of bootcamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      I feel as though working in pairs for pair coding will help me with this
      as well.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Non-technical skills - human skills - I would like to see developed in
      myself while at EDA.
    </h3>
    <p>
      I’m most looking forward to developing my communication sills in a
      different context to what I’m used to. I think having to do the pair
      coding and speaking in front of groups will be uncomfortable yet
      beneficial to improving those areas.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’d also like to work on my leadership skills. I generally feel more
      comfortable being in the drivers seat (so to speak). With a bit of work on
      my communication and leadership skills I feel as if I could be quite good
      at leading.
    </p>
    <h3>Expectations of myself on Bootcamp.</h3>
    <p>
      I’m planning on sticking to the process I’ve been fine tuning over the
      course of foundations. I expect that I won’t be able to adhere to quite
      the same routine given there will be group projects, but still plan on
      taking regular breaks away from the screen, to let information digest.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m committed to making sure I spend enough time to properly relax. I’ve
      hit burnout in the past and so will be paying attention to how I’m feeling
      a little more, to ensure I don’t break.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for working with everyone else. The plan is to stick to the usual of
      communicating myself and feelings/abilities to anyone I may be working
      with, and ensuring communication is kept up over the course of any
      projects. This way anyone I’m working with will know where I’m at and
      won’t get any nasty surprises if they expect something I’m not yet able to
      deliver. Facilitators will also be able to tailor my learning experience
      with this level of open comms so I can get the most out of my study. Of
      course I plan to always conduct myself with professionalism and respect
      others at all times, both during study and beyond in the industry.
